# Optional env PORTAL_HTTPS=1 (connect-crm's portal only; needs caddy-sites.mjs and
# https-confirm.mjs next to this file): HTTPS for the portal without a redeploy per
# name — see "HTTPS for the portal" in docs/DEPLOY.md. Port 80 keeps serving; the
# droplet address gets a Let's Encrypt IP certificate when Caddy supports it; any
# name approved by /api/tenancy/tls-ask (the portal domain saved in Platform setup,
# organizations' addresses) gets an on-demand certificate; http:// redirects and
# HSTS start only once a name's certificate is confirmed. Optional PUBLIC_IP: the
# droplet's public IPv4 when the DigitalOcean metadata service does not answer.
# Without PORTAL_HTTPS (connect-mobile, older workflows) nothing below changes.
# PORTAL_HTTPS=1 for another Node app (connect-admin, the event-day app; needs
# caddy-sites.mjs next to this file) JOINS the portal's HTTPS instead: its http://
# site (:8081) keeps serving, and it gets its own HTTPS port (admin: 8444) on the
# names the portal serves, written to <app>.caddy only. It reads the portal's
# /etc/connect/https.json and needs the portal's on-demand options; until the
# portal's HTTPS is set up it stays exactly as without PORTAL_HTTPS.
# Optional env SITE_WILDCARD_DOMAIN (node apps; the portal): also serve
# <slug>.<that domain> and organizations' own domains over HTTPS (on-demand
# certificates, allowed only for real communities by /api/tenancy/tls-ask),
# and pass it to the app as PORTAL_BASE_DOMAIN. Unset: nothing changes.
#           (ignored for a worker: it serves nothing to the outside)
#   kind worker (connect-crm's background service only): no Caddy site; its env
#   file /srv/connect/<app>.env holds secrets, so the deploy installs it (root,
#   mode 600) before calling this, and this script never writes it.
